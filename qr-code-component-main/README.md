## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The relationship between the parent class and child class was a bother at first but now I have figured it out and leveled up on my styling. It's not the best but it's certainly a start.


### Continued development

Future improvements may include adding responsive design to the project and linking to my portfolio.

### Useful resources

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) For providing the design challenge
